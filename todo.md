-   [x] Service Provider
-   [x] Query Command
-   [x] Exception Command
-   [x] maybe change commands to brain:_ instead of make:_
-   [x] create a command to list all processes that exists with all the tasks and with all the required parameter on each task - Process1 1. Task 1 {name, email, jeremias} 2. Task 2 {name:string } // show type or not ? one line or multiple lines? 3. Task 3
    -   [ ] need to be able to list standalone tasks, everything that is not being used by as process
    -   [ ] or have 3 commands, one to show everything, one to show processes, one to show only tasks.. ??? maybe
